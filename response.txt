The concept of semantic tags is covered in Video 11 of Sigma Web Development course.

Semantic tags are explained from around 40 seconds onwards in this video. The instructor briefly introduces them and then delves deeper into their explanation, starting from approximately 56 seconds.

Later on, they elaborate further on the usage of semantic tags (starting at 244 seconds) to explain what makes them meaningful.

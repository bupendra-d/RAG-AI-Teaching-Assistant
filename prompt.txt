"where is semantic tags taught in this course?"
User asked this question related to video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video at what timestamp) and guide the user to go that particulr video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
